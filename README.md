## **To Do List**
- Add more features to LeNet.update_architecture
- Try the algorithm on other neuron network models

## To run it
- in one terminal
```
python -m visdom.server
```
Then go to that local host to see the visualization of result
- run train.py in another terminal
```
cd .\LeNet_Module_for_Digits_Recognition\
python train.py
```

## **Current Version: 0.1.0**
### Update Content:
- Improve the algorithm to train architecture during training epochs on LeNet
### **Version: 0.0.50**
### Update Content:
- Implement basic algorithm to update architecture during training epochs
### **Version: 0.0.50**
### Update Content:
- Implement basic algorithm to test different architecture before training epochs
### **Version: 0.0.10**
### Update Content:
- Implement LeNet model for digits recognization
- Implement of visualization of results
### **Version: 0.0.05**
### Update Content:
- Build Pytorch environment using anaconda and link it to VSCode
- Link the local repository to the github remote repository
